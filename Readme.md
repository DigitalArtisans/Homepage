### WHAT IS THIS?
Digital Artisans is a place where pixel artists, code poets, copywriting wordsmiths and masters of the digital arts can escape the confines of solitude and aid in each others enlightenment.
We come here to communicate with our peers, to collaborate on wonderful new ideas and to discuss which thrift store truly has the most beautiful chequered shirts.

### WHO IS THIS?
The roots of Digital Artisans mainly originated from all over Scotland, however some of our brood have flown the nest and now live in sunnier climates.

They include; residents of Glasgow's [Rookie Oven coworking space](rookieoven.com/coworking/), Edinburgh's [Codebase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com/about/), freelancers, and other darn creative types.

#### Slackin
We use the awesome [Slackin](http://rauchg.com/slackin) to generate realtime user counts illustrating how many of our lovely masters of the digital arts are currently residing in our Slack community.

#### Credits
