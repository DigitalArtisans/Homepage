### WHAT IS THIS?
Digital Artisans is a place where pixel artists, code poets, copywriting wordsmiths and masters of the digital arts can escape the confines of solitude and aid in each others enlightenment.
We come here to communicate with our peers, to collaborate on wonderful new ideas and to discuss which thrift store truly has the most beautiful chequered shirts.

### Slackin
We use the awesome [Slackin](http://rauchg.com/slackin) to generate realtime user counts illustrating how many of our lovely masters of the digital arts are currently residing in our Slack community.

### Credits

[Aaron Bassett](http://aaronbassett.com/) put this all together so we can live in beautiful harmony.
